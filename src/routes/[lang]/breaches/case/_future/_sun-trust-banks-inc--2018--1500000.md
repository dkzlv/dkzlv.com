"SunTrust Banks Inc. said an employee may have stolen the information of about 1.5 million customers and provided it to a “criminal third party,” the latest example of a potential breach that underscores the vulnerability of consumers’ private data.The Atlanta-based bank on Friday said the employee, who no longer works at SunTrust, attempted to access client information, although it has “not identified significant fraudulent activity” around the accounts involved."
