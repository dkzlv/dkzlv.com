"Late last week, a password leak hit Twitter, and the company locked millions of user accounts as a result.
It was reported that the login credentials of more than 32 million Twitter users
 were compromised. According to LeakedSource, which indexes hacked 
credentials from data breaches, the credentials are being traded on the 
Dark Web for about 10 bitcoin a pop or a little under $6,000.
LeakedSource goes on to note that passwords are stored as plain text 
files, and many seem to be attached to Russian users. That detail 
indicates that the passwords were stolen from users, as opposed to 
through a hack into Twitter’s central systems.
In response to the leak, Twitter quickly initiated forced resets for many of its users."More Information: http://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2016/twitter-account-lockou...
