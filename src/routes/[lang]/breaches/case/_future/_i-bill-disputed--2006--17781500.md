# iBill [disputed]

A dishonest insider or possibly 
            malicious software linked to iBill was used to post names, phone numbers, 
            addresses, e-mail addresses, Internet IP addresses, login names and passwords, 
            credit card types and purchase amount online. Credit card account 
            numbers, expiration dates, security codes, and Social Security numbers were NOT included, 
            but in our opinion the affected individuals could be vulnerable to 
            social engineering to obtain such information. Whether iBill is the source of the breach has been disputed.
