# Fidelity National Information Services

"A senior database administrator at a subsidiary of Fidelity National Information Services who was responsible for defining and enforcing data access rights at the firm took data belonging to as many as 8.5 million consumers -- not 2.3 million, as originally disclosed by the company. . .  .On July 3, Fidelity National disclosed that a database administrator, who is no longer with the company, had illegally downloaded and sold customer data to a data broker. The data broker, in turn, sold a subset of the data to other direct marketing companies. The stolen data included names, addresses, birth dates, bank account and credit card information, the company said."
