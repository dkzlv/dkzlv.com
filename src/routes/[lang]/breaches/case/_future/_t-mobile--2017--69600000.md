"A bug on T-Mobile‘s website may have allowed hackers to view your personal information. The bug, which has since been patched, allowed hackers to view your email address, account number, and even your phone’s IMSI number (a unique number that identifies subscribers). According to the researcher that found the bug, there was no way to prevent someone writing a script and finding out the information for all 69.6 million potential victims."
