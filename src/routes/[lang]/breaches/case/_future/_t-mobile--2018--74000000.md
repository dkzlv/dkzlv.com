# T-Mobile

ZDNet's Zach Whittaker reports:"A bug in T-Mobile's website let anyone access the personal account details of any customer with just their cell phone number.The flaw, since fixed, could have been exploited by anyone who knew where to look -- a little-known T-Mobile subdomain that staff use as a customer care portal to access the company's internal tools. The subdomain -- promotool.t-mobile.com, which can be easily found on search engines -- contained a hidden API that would return T-Mobile customer data simply by adding the customer's cell phone number to the end of the web address.. . . .The returned data included a customer's full name, postal address, billing account number, and in some cases information about tax identification numbers. The data also included customers' account information, such as if a bill is past-due or if the customer had their service suspended.The data also included references to account PINs used by customers as a security question when contacting phone support."T-Mobile had 74 million customers. Though it is unknown how many records were stolen or inappropriately accessed, reportedly all 74 million customers records were inappropriately exposed.
