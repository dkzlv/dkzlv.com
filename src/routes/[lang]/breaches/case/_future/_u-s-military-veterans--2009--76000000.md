The issue involves a defective              hard drive the agency sent back to its vendor for repair and recycling              without first destroying the data. The hard drive helped power eVetRecs,              the system veterans use to request copies of their health records              and discharge papers. When the drive failed last year, the agency              returned the drive to GMRI, the contractor that sold it to them, for              repair. GMRI determined it couldn't be fixed, and ultimately              passed it to another firm to be recycled. The drive was part of a              RAID array of six drives containing an Oracle database that held detailed              records on 76 million veterans, including millions of Social Security              numbers dating to 1972, when the military began using individuals'              Social Security numbers as their service numbers.
