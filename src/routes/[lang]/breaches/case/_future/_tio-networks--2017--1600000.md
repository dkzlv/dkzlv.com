"PayPal's recently-acquired payment processor TIO Networks has revealed that up to 1.6 million customers have had their information stolen in a recent data breach.Last week, the Vancouver, Canada-based TIO Networks said that following the suspension of operations, evidence has been uncovered of a data breach due to "unauthorized access."In a statement, the company said that unknown attackers were able to gain access to "locations that stored personal information of some of TIO's customers and customers of TIO billers."In total, up to 1.6 million customers may have had their information leaked, which could include personally identifiable information (PII) or potentially financial data."
