Under Armour says roughly 150 million MyFitnessPal users are affected by a breach of their wildly popular fitness app "MyFitnessPal", which it discovered earlier this week. It said on Thursday that an "unauthorized party" acquired data about these users late last month."Under Armour is working with leading data security firms to assist in its investigation, and also coordinating with law enforcement authorities,"  the company said in a statement. "The investigation indicates that the affected information included usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords — the majority with the hashing function called bcrypt used to secure passwords."Under Armour said the hacker would not have been able to obtain users' payment details or information like Social Security numbers or driver's license numbers. The company has begun notifying users via messages in the app and emails.
