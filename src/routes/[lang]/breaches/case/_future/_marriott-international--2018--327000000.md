Marriott International disclosed a massive security breach of the reservations system for its Starwood Hotels and Resorts brand, a hack it said Friday may have compromised private info on up to 500 million guests.According to Marriott, for around 327 million Starwood guests, the database included such personal information as name, mailing address, phone number, email address, passport number, date of birth, and gender. For some Starwood customers, the hacked database also stored payment card numbers and expiration dates, although Marriott said that information was encrypted.
