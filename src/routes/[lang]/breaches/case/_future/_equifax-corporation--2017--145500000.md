"Equifax, which supplies credit information and other information services, said Thursday that a data breach could have potentially affected 143 million consumers in the United States.Equifax said it discovered the breach on July 29. "Criminals exploited a U.S. website application vulnerability to gain access to certain files," the company said."Equifax said exposed data includes names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, addresses and some driver's license numbers, all of which the company aims to protect for its customers.The company added that 209,000 U.S. credit card numbers were obtained, in addition to "certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers."Link to Equifax breach notification: https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/ UPDATE: (10/02/2017): "Equifax said hackers may have stolen the personal information of 2.5 million more U.S. consumers than it initially estimated, bringing the total to 145.5 million.The company said the additional customers  were not victims of a new attack but rather victims who the company had not counted before. Equifax hired the forensic security firm Mandiant to investigate the breach, and it finished its report on Sunday."https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/10/02/equifax-breach-hit-2-5-mi... UPDATE: (02/10/2017): "On Friday, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. , interim CEO of Equifax, citing 'what appears to be misleading, incomplete, or contradictory information' provided to Congress and the public about the breach of data on 145 million Americans. She demanded answers within a week.Equifax stated last year that hackers primarily accessed 'names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers…credit numbers…and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information,' Warren said.But The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that hackers accessed 'such data as tax identification numbers, email addresses, and drivers' license information beyond the license numbers [Equifax] originally disclosed,'  Warren added."https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/314389/
