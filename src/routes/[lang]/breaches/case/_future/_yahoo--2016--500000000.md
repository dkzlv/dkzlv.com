"Yahoo is poised to confirm a massive data breach of its 
service, according to several sources close to the situation. The 
company was the victim of hacking that has exposed several hundred 
million user accounts. 
While sources were unspecific about the extent of the 
incursion, since there is the likelihood of government investigations 
and legal action related to the breach, they noted that it is widespread
 and serious. 
Earlier this summer, Yahoo said it was investigating a 
data breach in which hackers claimed to have access to 200 million user 
accounts and one was selling them online."More Information: http://www.recode.net/2016/9/22/13012836/yahoo-is-expected-to-confirm-ma...Yahoo statement: https://help.yahoo.com/kb/account/SLN27925.html?impressions=trueUpdate (12/14/2016): "Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) warned on Wednesday that it had uncovered yet another massive cyber attack, saying data from more than 1 billion user accounts was compromised in August 2013, making it the largest breach in history.The number of affected accounts was double the number implicated in 2014 breach that the internet company disclosed in September and blamed on hackers working on behalf of a government."More information: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-cyber-idUSKBN1432WZYahoo statement: https://help.yahoo.com/kb/account/SLN27925.html?impressions=true
