# J.P Morgan Chase

The FBI is investigating a sophisticated hacking attack on JP Morgan Chase and potentially seven other financial institutions. Originally it was reported that possibly one to four other institutions may have been affected, but it appears that the breach could be much larger than originally thought.The hackers, who are reportedly Russian, gained enough personal information to completely wipe out bank accounts. The sophisticated and coordinated attacks go beyond the typical criminal hacker (s) according to authorities. Investigators are looking into the reasons behind the coordinated attack. It appears that not only did the hackers gain access to the accounts, but also altered and possibly deleted information.The attack appears to have been coordinated and directed at specific JP Morgan Chase employees to gain access to their computers and databases at the bank.Experts are communicating that the hackers would have had to of spent a significant amount of time researching and studying the record system of the bank prior to attempting any kind of unauthorized access. "What was even more concerning is these hackers were able to modify records using high-level credentials and do it in a way that was undetected."More Information: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/28/fbi-reportedly-probing-hack-j...http://www.cnet.com/news/jpmorgan-hackers-altered-deleted-bank-records-s...UPDATE (9/16/2014): After further investigation by authorities and Chase Bank, the breach they suffered isn't as severe as originally anticipated. The bank has confirmed that the hackers were able to gain access only to names, addresses and phone numbers, no financial or bank account information was accessed.

& Co. faced this summer compromised personal information in much greater numbers than first reported. Originally the numbers reported were over 1 million affected customers. After an investigation, JP Morgan Chase reports that hackers gained access to data on more than 76 million account holders--names, addresses, phone numbers and emails. Information on an additional 7 million small businesses was obtained as well. ""JPMorgan
 Chase said that names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses 
were stolen from the company's servers, but only customers who use the 
websites Chase.com and JPMorganOnline and the apps ChaseMobile and JPMorgan Mobile were affected".More Information:  http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/ap/jpmorgan-says-data-breach-aff...UPDATE (12/22/2014): The computer breach at JP Morgan Chase could have been avoided according to security experts if the bank had installed an easy security fix to a server that was overlooked.More Information: http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/12/22/entry-point-of-jpmorgan-data-brea...
