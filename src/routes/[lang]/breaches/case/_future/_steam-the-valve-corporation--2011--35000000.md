# Steam (The Valve Corporation)

The November 6 defacement of Steam forums led to an investigation that revealed hackers had accessed a Steam database with sensitive user information. The database contained user names, hashed and salted passwords, game purchases, email addresses, billing addresses, and encrypted credit card information.  Users were prompted to change their Steam forum passwords and encouraged to change their Steam account passwords.  Anyone using their Steam forum password for other websites should change their password since hackers could have obtained email address and password combinations. Steam is the Valve Corporation's social-distribution network.  People who use the company's online gaming content were affected.UPDATE (11/16/2012): A judge dismissed a class action lawsuit related to the November 6, 2011 breach.  The plaintiffs of the lawsuit used Steam to purchase and access online gaming content. They alleged present and future harm as a result of the breach.  According to the judge who dismissed the lawsuit, the plaintiffs did not prove that they were harmed by the Steam breach.
