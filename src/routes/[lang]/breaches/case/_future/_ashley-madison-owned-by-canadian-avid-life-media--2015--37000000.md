# Ashley Madison (owned by Canadian Avid Life Media)

Ashley Madison, the online cheating website, confirmed a hack of their system, exposing 40 million records.The data that was stolen included the company's user databases, financial records along with other confidential information. The company has not stated the exact personal information compromised."Reached by KrebsOnSecurity late Sunday evening, ALM Chief Executive Noel Biderman confirmed the hack, and said the company was “working diligently and feverishly” to take down ALM’s intellectual property. Indeed, in the short span of 30 minutes between that brief interview and the publication of this story, several of the Impact Team’s Web links were no longer responding.""Besides snippets of account data apparently sampled at random from among some 40 million users across ALM’s trio of properties, the hackers leaked maps of internal company servers, employee network account information, company bank account data and salary information."More information: http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/07/online-cheating-site-ashleymadison-ha...UPDATE (8/18/2015): Hackers who stole sensitive customer information originally reported back in July, have now stated that because the company has not taken down their site as requested by the hackers, sensitive customer information has been posted online."A data dump, 9.7 gigabytes in size, was posted on Tuesday to the dark web using an Onion address accessible only through the Tor browser. The files appear to include account details and log-ins for some 32 million users of the social networking site, touted as the premier site for married individuals seeking partners for affairs. Seven years worth of credit card and other payment transaction details are also part of the dump, going back to 2007. The data, which amounts to millions of payment transactions, includes names, street address, email address and amount paid, but not credit card numbers; instead it includes four digits for each transaction that may be the last four digits of the credit card or simply a transaction ID unique to each charge."Raja Bhatia, AshleyMadison's founding Chief Technology Officer stated that these recent data dumps are not legitimate. His team has been reviewing 30 to 80 reported data dumps daily and that "most of these dumps are entirely fake and being used by other organizations to capture the attention that's been built up through this release"More Information: http://www.wired.com/2015/08/happened-hackers-posted-stolen-ashley-madis...http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/was-the-ashley-madison-database-leaked/
