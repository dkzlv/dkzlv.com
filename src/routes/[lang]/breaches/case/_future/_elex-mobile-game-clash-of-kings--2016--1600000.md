# Elex (mobile game Clash of Kings)

"A hacker has targeted the official forum for popular mobile game "Clash of Kings," making off with close to 1.6 million accounts.The hack was carried out on July 14 by a hacker, who wants to remain nameless, and a copy of the leaked database was provided to breach notification site LeakedSource.com, which allows users to search their usernames and email addresses in a wealth of stolen and hacked data.Three major social networks have quietly fallen victim to data breaches. Despite some success, patience and trust is now fading.In a sample given to ZDNet, the database contains (among other things) usernames, email addresses, IP addresses (which can often determine the user's location), device identifiers, as well as Facebook data and access tokens (if the user signed in with their social account). Passwords stored in the database are hashed and salted."  Note: Company breach affected customers within the US
