# deviantART, Silverpop Systems Inc.

Mirroring the Gawker an McDonald's breaches earlier this month, hackers exposed the email addresses, user names and birth dates of the entire deviantART user database.  Hackers were able to breach deviantART's marketing company Silverpop Systems Inc. Passwords and sensitive information were not exposed, but the breach is expected to increase spam for registered users.
