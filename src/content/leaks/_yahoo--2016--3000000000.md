"Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) warned on Wednesday that it had uncovered yet another massive cyber attack, saying data from more than 1 billion user accounts was compromised in August 2013, making it the largest breach in history.The number of affected accounts was double the number implicated in 2014 breach that the internet company disclosed in September and blamed on hackers working on behalf of a government.Yahoo required all of its customers to reset their passwords - a stronger measure than it took after the previous breach was discovered, when it only recommended a password reset. Yahoo also said Wednesday that it believes hackers responsible for the previous breach had also accessed the company’s proprietary code to learn how to forge "cookies" that would allow hackers to access an account without a password."Yahoo badly screwed up," said Bruce Schneier, a cryptologist and one of the world's most respected security experts. "They weren't taking security seriously and that's now very clear. I would have trouble trusting Yahoo going forward."Yahoo was tentative in its description of new problems, saying the incident was "likely" distinct from the one it reported in September and that stolen information "may have included" names, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers."More information: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-cyber-idUSKBN1432WZYahoo statement: https//yahoo.com/security-updateUPDATE (2/15/2017):"Yahoo's newly issued warning to users about malicious hacks is related to a third data breach that the company disclosed in December 2016.A warning sent to some Yahoo users Wednesday read: "Based on the ongoing investigation, we believe a forged cookie may have been used in 2015 or 2016 to access your account."This breach was previously revealed in a December 2016 statement from Yahoo that also provided information on a separate hack that occurred in August 2013 involving more than 1 billion accounts. In addition, some of the 2015 and 2016 incidents have been tied to a "state-sponsored actor" that was involved in a different 2014 breach that affected up to 500 million accounts."Forged cookies" are digital keys that allow access to information without re-entering passwords. The leaked data included email addresses, birth dates and answers to security questions. Yahoo declined to say how many people were affected."More information: http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/15/yahoo-sends-new-warning-to-customers-abou...UPDATE (3/15/2017): The U.S. Justice Department today unsealed indictments against four men accused of hacking into half-billion Yahoo email accounts.  Two of the men named in the indictments worked for a unit of the Russian Federal Security Services (FSB) that serves as the FBI's point of contact in Moscow on cybercrime cases."More Information: http://krebsonsecurity.com/UPDATE (9/7/2017): Link to Yahoo judgement: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3986196-Yahoo-judgement-on-data-...UPDATE (10/3/2017): "Yahoo has tripled down on what was already the largest data breach in history, saying it affected all 3 billion accounts on its service, not the 1 billion it revealed late last year.The company announced Tuesday that it's providing notice to additional user accounts affected by the August 2013 data theft."More Information: http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_YAHOO_DATA_BREACH?SITE=AP&SECT...
