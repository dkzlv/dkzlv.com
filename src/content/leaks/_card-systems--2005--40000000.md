Over 40 million card accounts 
            were exposed to potential fraud due to a security breach that occurred 
            at a third-party processor of payment card transactions. Of the more 
            than 40 million accounts exposed, information on 68,000 Mastercard 
            accounts, 100,000 Visa accounts and 30,000 accounts from other card 
            brands are known to have been exported by the hackers. The data exported 
            included names, card numbers and card security codes.UPDATE (2/23/2006) CardSystems agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it failed to take appropriate security measures to protect sensitive personal information. The company must implement a comprehensive security program and obtain audits every 2 years for 20 years.UPDATE (5/12/2006) CardSystems filed for bankruptcy.UPDATE

            Merrick Bank has launched a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Savvis, 
            accusing the vendor of erroneously telling it that CardSystems Solutions 
            complied with Visa and MasterCard security regulations less than a 
            year before the payment processor's systems were hacked, compromising 
            up to 40 million credit card accounts. Less than a year later the 
            security breach occurred. Hackers were able to get hold of the data 
            because CardSystems kept unencrypted card information on its servers 
            - in contravention of the regulations for which Savvis certified it.
