The athletic-wear company alerted customers on Thursday about a possible data breach on its U.S. website. A preliminary investigation found the leaked data includes contact information, usernames and encrypted passwords, the company said in a statement. Adidas said it does not believe any credit card or health and fitness information was compromised.“We are alerting certain consumers who purchased on adidas.com/US about a potential data security incident. At this time this is a few million consumers,” a spokeswoman said in an email.
