The Office of Personnel Management will be notifying over 4 million current and former federal employees of a data breach thought to be perpetrated by Chinese hackers. Federal officials stated that the hacking exposed employee's job assignments, performance and training. Officials stated that no "background or clearance investigations" were exposed. They are not stating whether or not the information that was exposed included any Social Security information or financial information.
