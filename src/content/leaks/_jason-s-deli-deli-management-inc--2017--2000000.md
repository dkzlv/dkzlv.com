# Jason's Deli - Deli Management, Inc. 

On December 22, 2017, Jason’s Deli was notified by payment processors that credit card security personnel had informed it that a large quantity of payment card information had appeared for sale on the “dark web,” and that an analysis of the data indicated that at least a portion of the data may have come from various Jason’s Deli locations. From our initial investigation findings, criminals deployed RAM-scraping malware on a number of our point-of-sales (POS) terminals at various corporate-owned Jason’s Deli restaurants Based on the facts known to Jason’s Deli at this time, the Company believes that the criminals used the malware to obtain payment card information off of the POS terminals beginning on June 8, 2017. Our investigation has determined that approximately 2 million unique payment card numbers may have been impacted in total.
