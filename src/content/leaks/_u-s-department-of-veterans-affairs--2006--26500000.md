On May 3, data of all American 
            veterans who were discharged since 1975 including names, Social Security 
            numbers, dates of birth and in many cases phone numbers and addresses, 
            were stolen from a VA employee's home. Theft of the laptop and computer 
            storage device included data of 26.5 million veterans. The data did 
            not contain medical or financial information, but may have disability 
            numerical rankings.  UPDATE 
            (6/29/06): The stolen laptop computer and the external hard 
            drive were recovered.  UPDATE
            (7/14/06): FBI claims no data had been taken from stolen computer. 
             UPDATE(8/5/06): 
            Two teens were arrested in the theft of the laptop. UPDATE
            (8/25/06): In an Aug. 25 letter, Secretary Nicholson told veterans 
            of the decision to not offer them credit monitoring services. Rather 
            the VA has contracted with a company to conduct breach analysis to 
            monitor for patterns of misuse.  UPDATE
            (11/23/07): A federal judge questioned the Veterans Affairs Department's 
            computer security and ruled Friday that lawsuits can go forward over 
            the theft of computer equipment containing data on 26.5 million veterans. 
            The lawsuits have been filed as potential class-action cases representing 
            every veteran whose data was released. UPDATE
            (1/23/09): The Department of Veterans Affairs has agreed to pay $20 
            million to current and former military personnel to settle a class 
            action lawsuit. UPDATE
            (6/16/09): No less than $75 will be paid for any valid claim, up to 
            a cap of $1,500. If your expenses were higher than that, you might 
            want to opt out of the class-action portion so you can file for your 
            actual damages. In that case, you need to file a letter so it is received 
            by June 29, 2009. You have until Nov. 27, 2009, to mail your claim 
            form to VA Settlement Claims, P.O. Box 6727, Portland, OR 97228-9767.
