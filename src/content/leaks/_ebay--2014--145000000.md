# Ebay

Ebay, the online auction site, was hacked between late February and early March with login credentials obtained from employees. The hackers then accessed a database containing user records of approximately 145 million users which they appeared to have copied. The information included email addresses, encrypted passwords, birth dates, mailing addresses. The company reports that no financial data or PayPal databases were compromised. The company is encouraging all who were affected to login into their account and change their passwords.Ebay has provided the following links for additional information:http://www.ebayinc.com/http://www.ebayinc.com/in_the_news/story/faq-ebay-password-change.
