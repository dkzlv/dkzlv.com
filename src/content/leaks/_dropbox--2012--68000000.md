# Dropbox

Dropbox users began receiving spam from email sources posing as Dropbox.  Many users claim that Dropbox must have suffered a breach because email addresses they used specifically and solely for Dropbox were compromised.UPDATE (07/20/2012): Dropbox investigated customer concerns of a data breach but could not find any evidence of an unauthorized intrusion or activity as of July 20.UPDATE (07/31/2012): Dropbox has confirmed that some accounts were accessed by hackers. One of the compromised accounts was that of a Dropbox employee.  The employee's account contained a project document of user email addresses.  Dropbox required some users to change their passwords and increased their security by adding a two-factor authentication system, new automated mechanisms to help identify suspicious activity, and a page that allows users to monitor active logins to their accounts.UPDATE (8/31/2016): Per a recent report on the Dropbox breach in 2012, 68 million of the user account details were leaked on the dark web four years later. The information leaked included email addresses and passwords which were hashed. "It was not previously known how many users were affected by the 2012 
hack, according to Motherboard, which says that the leaked data does not
 appear to be posted on the dark web. A senior Dropbox employee told 
Motherboard that the data is legitimate."
