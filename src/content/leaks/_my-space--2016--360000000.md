These usernames and passwords were exposed due to "unsalted SHA-1 hashes" that allowed hackers to run certain numbers they can obtain with a cracking server, which can process millions of SHA-1 calculations per second.The breach has been reported to only be usernames and passwords.Time Inc. who owns MySpace has confirmed the breach.
