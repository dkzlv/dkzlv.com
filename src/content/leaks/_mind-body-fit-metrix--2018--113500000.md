# MindBody - FitMetrix

As reported by TechChrunch:FitMetrix, a fitness technology and performance tracking company owned by gym booking giant Mindbody, has exposed millions of user records because it left several of its servers without a password. . .Last week, a security researcher found three FitMetrix unprotected servers leaking customer data.It isn’t known how long the servers had been exposed, but the servers were indexed by Shodan, a search engine for open ports and databases, in September.Bob Diachenko, Hacken.io’s director of cyber risk research, found the databases containing 113.5 million records — though it’s not known how many users were directly affected. Each record contained a user’s name, gender, email address, phone numbers, profile photos, their primary workout location, emergency contacts and more. Many of the records were not fully complete.
