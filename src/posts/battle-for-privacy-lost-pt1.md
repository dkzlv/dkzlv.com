It's been a few years since I started learning stuff about programming. It's a usual thing when you're kind of the only IT guy among your friends: you have nothing interesting to discuss while hanging our in a bar. Of all the boring topics that I've tried to tell my friends about there's one, that really shocked them. It's about the privacy and that literally nothing can be hidden from the big corporations.

But how do they do that? Can inkognito mode in your browser save you from surveliance? Is VPN the solution? Or should you just pack your shit, buy a small house in the middle of nowhere (with cash only) and move there and start living a life of Captain Fantastic?

Disclaimer: This one is gonna be a long one. Most probably, if you work in IT it won't be big news for you.

## Should you really care about this?

That is the most important question. Most people I know easily say stuff like _"I have nothing to hide. Why would I care?"_. It is a common misinterpretation that Edward Snowden commented the best way possible:

> Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.

To understand why your privacy is important we first need to understand what data a certain company can obtain about us and our habits. 

# How do _they_ collect the data?

First of all, who are _they_? It's wrong to only accuse Google or Facebook of wrongdoing, because most of the businesses in modern era try as hard as they can to collect as much data about you as it's possible.

## Loyalty programs

If you visit a Walmart you are an anonymous person to the store. They know nothing about you and it is practically impossible to match you to a certain row in their DB. But you purchase history, your demographics and all of your patterns are actually super important for the business. That is why loaylty programs exist in the first place. Most of the time loyalty program's discount is a tax on anonimity, because noone in their right mind would offer you a real discount (read: the one, that cuts business' real profit) that easy — just fill out a small form and you're good to go.

Except now you will get a ton of marketing messages, that are hard to opt-out without losing your card, and your purchase pattern will be sold to the manufacturer of all the goods that you buy. They can even be sold to internet companies. Remember: you wrote down all of your credentials in the form, so it's a piece of cake to match you to an ID in Google's DB.

## Photos on phones

1. iOS photo library — geolocation & on-device machine learning nudes detection
2. Chrome Extensions — you practically has control over everything user ever do in their browser
3. finger printing — the combination of your screen resolution, fonts in your system, device, locale (and optionally IP) helps track you down quite accurately
